# Issue #14: Voice Recognition Not Responding to User Input

## üéØ **Problem Summary**
SAGE can speak to users but cannot hear or respond to voice input. The voice recognition system appears to initialize successfully but fails to detect or process user speech, making voice interaction non-functional.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**
After analyzing the voice recognition code (`modules/voice/recognition.py`), several potential issues have been identified:

### Technical Issues:
1. **Microphone Calibration Problems**: The system calibrates for ambient noise but may not be properly detecting speech
2. **Threading Issues**: Voice recognition runs in background threads with complex async/sync interactions
3. **Audio Processing Pipeline**: Multiple potential failure points in the audio callback chain
4. **Dependency Configuration**: PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, and Whisper integration may have compatibility issues

### Specific Problem Areas:
- `_audio_callback()` method may not be properly triggered
- `start_listening()` background process might be failing silently  
- Energy threshold detection could be misconfigured
- Async task creation in callback (`asyncio.create_task()`) may fail in thread context

## üéØ **Expected Behavior**
- User says wake word "sage" ‚Üí SAGE should respond with acknowledgment
- User speaks command ‚Üí SAGE should process and respond appropriately  
- Clear audio feedback and processing indicators
- Robust error handling with informative messages

## üêõ **Current Behavior**
- SAGE initializes voice recognition without errors
- Microphone calibration appears successful
- No response to user speech input
- No error messages indicating recognition failure
- Voice synthesis works (SAGE can speak)

## üõ†Ô∏è **Proposed Solution**

### Phase 1: Diagnostic Enhancement
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging to all voice recognition methods
- [ ] Implement audio level monitoring to verify microphone input
- [ ] Add callback debugging to track audio processing pipeline
- [ ] Create voice recognition test mode with visual feedback

### Phase 2: Threading & Async Fixes  
- [ ] Fix async task creation in threaded callbacks
- [ ] Implement proper event loop handling for background threads
- [ ] Add timeout and retry mechanisms for recognition failures
- [ ] Ensure proper cleanup of background listening processes

### Phase 3: Audio Processing Improvements
- [ ] Implement manual energy threshold adjustment
- [ ] Add voice activity detection debugging
- [ ] Improve ambient noise calibration process
- [ ] Add multiple recognition engine fallbacks

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements
- [ ] Add visual indicators for listening state
- [ ] Implement "push-to-talk" mode as fallback
- [ ] Add audio level visualization for troubleshooting
- [ ] Create guided voice setup process

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**

### Unit Tests:
- [ ] Test microphone initialization and calibration
- [ ] Test audio callback pipeline  
- [ ] Test recognition engine switching
- [ ] Test background thread management

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Test full wake word ‚Üí command ‚Üí response flow
- [ ] Test with different audio hardware configurations
- [ ] Test noise tolerance and adaptation
- [ ] Test with various Whisper model sizes

### Hardware Compatibility:
- [ ] Test on different operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- [ ] Test with various microphone types (built-in, USB, Bluetooth)
- [ ] Test in different acoustic environments
- [ ] Test WSL/virtualized environment compatibility

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### Files to Modify:
- `modules/voice/recognition.py` - Core recognition logic
- `modules/voice/__init__.py` - Voice module initialization  
- `modules/voice/voice_config.yaml` - Configuration defaults
- `main.py` - Voice module integration and error handling

### New Features to Add:
- Audio level monitoring and visualization
- Recognition confidence scoring
- Fallback recognition modes  
- Advanced debugging and diagnostics
- Hardware compatibility detection

### Configuration Enhancements:
```yaml
recognition:
  debug_mode: true
  audio_monitoring: true  
  visual_feedback: true
  push_to_talk_fallback: true
  
  # Enhanced audio settings
  energy_threshold: auto  # auto-detect or manual value
  dynamic_threshold: true
  min_audio_level: 100    # Minimum detectable audio
  calibration_duration: 3 # Seconds for ambient noise
  
  # Recognition robustness  
  retry_attempts: 3
  timeout_handling: graceful
  fallback_modes: [whisper, google, manual]
```

## üìä **Success Metrics**
- [ ] 95%+ wake word detection accuracy
- [ ] Sub-3 second response time for voice commands  
- [ ] Clear error messages for audio hardware issues
- [ ] Successful operation across major operating systems
- [ ] Graceful degradation when hardware unavailable

## üîÑ **Dependencies**
- Requires testing with various PyAudio/PortAudio configurations
- May need Whisper model optimization for faster recognition
- Coordinate with NLP module for better intent processing
- Consider integration with system audio controls

## üìà **Priority: HIGH**
Voice interaction is a core feature of SAGE. Without working voice recognition, users cannot access the primary interface method, significantly reducing the assistant's usability and value proposition.
